# Instagram two factor Bruteforce
Recently a friend lost his instagram account and in the login he wanted the two-factor authentication code, but the email associated with his account was now eliminated, so I decided to generate all the possible codes, which is very easy, being only numbers and a 6-digit string

Soon a script that will test every single code, assuming each code tested in 1 second would take around 10 days

# I take no responsibility for the use of the file, it is only for educational purposes

# GeneratoreCodiciInstagram.py --> Python algorithm to generate possible code

# TwoFactorBypass.py --> Censured algorithm to test every single code

# I censured the code because is only for educational purpose, and don't know the risk of take it run
