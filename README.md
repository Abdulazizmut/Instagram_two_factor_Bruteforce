# Instagram two factor Bruteforce
Recently a friend lost his instagram account and in the login he wanted the two-factor authentication code, but the email associated with his account was now eliminated, so I decided to generate all the possible codes, which is very easy, being only numbers and a 6-digit string

Soon a script that will test every single code, assuming each code tested in 1 second would take around 10 days
